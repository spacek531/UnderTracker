A tool developed to aide in Underming by assisting the user in tracking merits earned by commanders in different personal groups or platforms. The only official download of this tool is from its Github repository at http://github.com/spacek531/UnderTracker

How to use:

1. Select the system you are undermining, and select the current tick's defense bonus for that power. If the target system is not listed, its name and trigger can be set manually
2. Set the submitted merits of the system
3. Set the names of the commanders undermining the system
4. Set the earned merits of the commanders undermining the system

Some stats are calculated based on the number of active commanders undermining a system. A commander's active state is set by the on/off button next to their name.

When undermining is finished, or you want a record of the current progress, clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button will copy to clipboard a snapshot of the current state of the tool, formatted for the Discord chat app.

Systems can be added or removed from the tool by editing systems.txt; more information about this file is found in the file itself.
Users' associated discord usernames can be added or removed from the tool by editing users.txt; more information about this file is found in the file itself.
